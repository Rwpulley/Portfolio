## Previous Business Experience

I am a part owner of a carpet cleaning company. I wanted to be able to analyze our biometrics to get a feel for how 
my technicians were doing with the additional services we provide and where they needed more training.

As well as which cities or zipcodes seemed to make more money and which areas I should spend more money on with our marketing budget.

This Portfolio contains a database that I designed with tables, views and stored procedures. In particular one of the [stored procedures](https://github.com/Rwpulley/Portfolio/blob/main/CarpetCleaning/StoredProcedures/JobDetails_ValidateExcelData.sql) I made is able to vaildate the information I entered into a Google spreadsheet from my business in order to keep the data clean. Another other [stored procedure](https://github.com/Rwpulley/Portfolio/blob/main/CarpetCleaning/StoredProcedures/JobDetails_LoadExcelData.sql) inserts the cleaned data from the large table into their respective tables. This can be used for most any carpet cleaning company as well as altered for use in other services industries.
